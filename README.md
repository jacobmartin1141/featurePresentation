# Intended Experience

Feature Presentation isn't so much meant to be a traditional web app, which views the user and the platform as distinct from one another, as much as it is meant to be a creativity enabler, a sort of chrome extension for the user's brain: At it's core, it's a fast and intuitive way to jott down ideas. The hope of it's design is that once it's fast and intuitive enough, once the bandwidth for transfering ideas between the user and the app is low enough, that the information will be able to move freely, and the app will become more like a natural feeling expansion to the user's biological RAM.

# Design Pillars

The typical user experience will have a couple of stages:
    1) Ideation: Write down and organize your thoughts into clearly defined design pillars. Every idea starts with intuition, and trying to define that intuition within the app will teach you the true idea's shape. This is the process of discovering what exactly it is that you're trying to accomplish with your project.
    2) Content: Your design pillars now will start to inform various new ideas for specific mechanics and gameplay loops. You will start with basic ideas again and then develope them and hone them down into a more whole form.
    3) Implementation: Having defined your goals and vision, you can now further clarify those ideas by defining how exactly you plan to implement them, details such as the structure of overarching systems, or choices between different engines, plug-ins and frameworks.

In defining, organizing, and laying out your thoughts relationally, you can gain new insight into potential oversights in the original concept. Edgecases, thing's you never considered or imagined which become highlighted by the newly gained perspective. You'll start to notice new connections between seemingly disparate parts, and contraditions that would have remained unnoticed until the prototyping stage.

Having organized your thoughts in a visual format, you also gain the ability to consider the process of development itself (stage 3), and what sort of approach would best fit your game's needs.
