# Feature Presentation

# Intended Experience

Feature Presentation isn't so much meant to be a traditional web app, which serves a market by solving a problem (though it does that as well), as much as it is meant to be a creativity enabler, a sort of extension of the user. At it's core, it's a fast and intuitive way to jott down ideas. The hope of it's design is that once it's fast and intuitive enough, once the bandwidth for communicating ideas between the user and the app is low enough, that information will be able to move freely, the app will become more like a technological extension to the user's biological RAM.

# Design Pillars

The typical user experience will have a couple of stages:
    1) Ideation: Write down and organize your thoughts into clearly defined design pillars. This is the process of discovering what exactly it is that you're trying to accomplish with your project.
    2) Content: Your design pillars now will start to inform various new ideas for specific mechanics and gameplay loops.
    3) Implementation: Having defined your goals and the game's ultimate shape or form, you can now further clarify those ideas by defining how exactly you plan to implement them, details such as the shape of overarching systems, or choices between different engines, plug-ins or frameworks.

In defining, organizing, and laying out your thoughts relationally, you can gain new insight into potential oversights in the original concept, thing's you never considered or imagined which become highlighted by the newly gained perspective.

Having organized your thoughts in a visual format, you also gain the ability to consider more big picture questions about the future development process, and what sorts of multi-staged approaches would best fit your game's needs.
