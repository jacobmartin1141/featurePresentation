# Feature Presentation

Organize your thoughts into clearly defined design pillars in the ideation stage, which informs the design of every mechanic during the content stage, which then informs the specific implementation of different systems in the development stage.

In defining, organizing, and laying out your thoughts relationally, gain new insight into potential oversights in the original concept, and clarify your vision overall.

Having organized your thoughts in a visual format, you also gain the ability to consider more big picture questions about the future development process, and what sorts of multi-staged approaches would best fit your game's needs.
